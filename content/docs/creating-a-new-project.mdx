# Creating a New Project to use "Your component library"

## Using NextJS
Create a new NextJS project using the following command

<CodeBlockWrapper size="full">
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```
</CodeBlockWrapper>

### Initial configuration

After running the command, you will be prompted with a series of questions, this is where you can configure your project to use "Your component library" with NextJS and Tailwind CSS.

<CodeBlockWrapper size="full">
```bash showLineNumbers /Yes/ /No/ /your-project-name/
What is your project named? your-project-name
Would you like to use TypeScript? Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No
Would you like to use App Router? Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias No
```
</CodeBlockWrapper>

That's it! You have successfully created a new project with NextJS and Tailwind CSS, so you can start building your project with "Your component library" only importing the components you need.
